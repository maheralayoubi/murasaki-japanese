                        <p>
                            All the applicants for employment prepare answers to a variety of interview questions, so it is sometimes difficult to evaluate properly their language and communication skills.
                            MJI can help your human resources team with arranging job interviews to foreign applicants, or conduct interviews on behalf.
                            We have professional methods of revealing their real language and communication skills, which will be better information for your decision-making than stereotypical scripted answers.

                        <h3>Cross-cultural Seminar for Japanese Supervisors</h3>
                        <p>
                            Foreign employees in Japanese companies are always required to understand Japanese corporate culture.
                            Only with this one-sided cultutral understanding, however, they cannot build good relationship with their companies.
                            Our cross-cultural seminar for Japanese supervisors introduce good tips on developing mutual undestanding between foreign employees and their companies.
                            At a result of this seminar, perticipants will be able to communicate with foreign employees more smoothly, with respect to their cultural background.
